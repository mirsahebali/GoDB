* Features 
** Basic CRUD Functionalities
** Relations between objects
** Interoparability 
-between different languages by running a daemon in the background and reading from it's provided output when making a syscall to it.
 
** Sockets/Websockets
** Concurrency
** Transactions
** Logs and check points
** Rollback and Recovery
- rollback to a checkpoint on failure
- This could be given as optional to add and use
** Permissions and Grant access in it
** Authentication and Read and Write ACCESS

* Principles
** /Normalization/
*** 1 - 5 Normal Forms
** ACID Principle 
*** Atomicity
*** Consistency
*** Isolation
*** Durability
** Concurrency
